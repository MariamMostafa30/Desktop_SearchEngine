# Desktop_SearchEngine
Search for your query phrase in your text documents in desktop.
After studying this semester information storage and retrieval , I started working on that project. It is a simple search engine. 
I use vector space model technique  to build it .
I built all functions from scratch using python language then I use kivy framework in order to create the GUI.
All you need to use it, is to pass(inside python file) your folder path that contains your text documents .

The idea is ,for example :

 if you want to know what are the documents that contain "Artificial Intelligence " phrase and you have for example 200 documents so instead of opening the folder and search for each file , you just will pass your folder and run my application and it will retrieve sorted documents that contains this phrase.
